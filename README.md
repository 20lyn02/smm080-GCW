<h1>Rainfall & Agriculture: Business Intelligence Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project explored the relationship between rainfall patterns and agricultural yields using Tableau. The objective was to design a professional poster presentation (conference style) that communicated key insights visually and clearly, demonstrating how data-driven storytelling can inform agricultural planning and policy.  
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Tableau</b> (dashboard & visual analytics)  
- <b>Excel / CSV</b> (rainfall & agricultural data preparation)  
- <b>Data Visualisation Principles</b> (CRAP design, Cairo’s “Truth & Beauty”)  

<h2>Methodology</h2>

1. <b>Data Preparation</b>  
   - Cleaned and structured rainfall–agriculture dataset.  
   - Removed inconsistencies and prepared relational structure for Tableau.  

2. <b>Exploratory Analysis</b>  
   - Examined rainfall trends by year, month, and region.  
   - Mapped agricultural yields against rainfall to identify correlations.  

3. <b>Dashboard Design</b>  
   - Built Tableau dashboard using CRAP design principles (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity).  
   - Designed for clear storytelling with multi-level perspectives (time trends, geographic distribution, yield comparisons).  

4. <b>Poster Development</b>  
   - Exported Tableau visualisations into a 3–5 page poster.  
   - Structured narrative around problem statement, methodology, insights, and implications.  

<h2>Findings</h2>

- Strong seasonal dependence between rainfall and agricultural output; crop yields in rain-fed regions showed higher volatility.  
- Regions with more stable rainfall demonstrated consistently higher yields and fewer shortfall events.  
- Identified “rainfall shock” years where sharp deficits aligned with significant declines in agricultural output.  
- Visual storytelling enabled stakeholders to quickly grasp the <b>cause-effect dynamics</b> between rainfall variability and food production.  
- The project demonstrated how **business intelligence tools** can transform raw climate–agriculture data into actionable insights for policy and resource planning.
